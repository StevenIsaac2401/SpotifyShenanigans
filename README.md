# Spotify Shenanigans ðŸŽµ

Repo for playing around with the Spotify API.

The current code in main allows you to:

1. Find a specified artist and list their top 10 most-listened to tracks (US-based)
2. Use the Spotify API to determine the mode (major or minor scale) and key of a given track

Future Ideas:
- Show real time guitar chords over lyrics
- Song transposition
